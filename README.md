# project-LIBRARY

### WHat I learnt
-  associate your DOM elements with the actual book objects in some way. One easy solution is giving them a data-attribute that corresponds to the index of the library array.

- button, type-button in forms for client-side scripting

- overLay, popup(MODAL) concept

- classList and display=none/block

- isNaN(), parseInt()-> return NaN if not a number

- client side form validation, along with frontend event to accept input(and close form)  or stay on same state( just return from the event )
